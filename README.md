# Hello, World! 👋 I'm @twp28
I'm a passionate front-end developer with a keen interest in integrating web3 libraries to enhance the crypto space. I believe in the sovereign handling of data, advocating for a world where data belongs solely to its owner.

## 🌱 Current Learning Journey
I'm currently expanding my skills in several exciting technologies, including:

- Next.js 13+
- Prisma ORM
- Tailwind CSS
- Flutter for mobile applications
- wagmi, rainbowkit, ethers for web3 

## 💞️ Collaboration
I'm actively seeking collaboration opportunities on web3 projects. If you're working on something and need a hand, or if you're interested in partnering up to create something new, I'd love to hear from you.
